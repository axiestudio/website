# ROBOTS.TXT - WEB CRAWLER CONTROL FILE
# 
# PRIMARY FUNCTION:
# This file tells search engine crawlers (bots) which pages they can and cannot access on your website.
# It's the first file most crawlers check when visiting your site, making it crucial for SEO and security.
# 
# DIRECTIVE IMPORTANCE:
# 
# 1. User-agent: * (CRITICAL)
#    - Specifies which bots these rules apply to
#    - "*" means ALL crawlers (Google, Bing, etc.)
#    - Can be specific: "User-agent: Googlebot"
# 
# 2. Allow: / (HIGH IMPORTANCE)
#    - Explicitly allows crawlers to access the root and all pages
#    - Overrides any conflicting Disallow rules
#    - Good practice for transparency
# 
# 3. Sitemap: URL (HIGH IMPORTANCE)
#    - Points crawlers to your sitemap location
#    - Helps discovery of all your pages
#    - Should be absolute URL
# 
# 4. Disallow: /path/* (SECURITY & SEO)
#    - Blocks crawlers from sensitive/irrelevant areas
#    - Saves crawl budget for important content
#    - Protects private sections
# 
# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Keep file at root level (/robots.txt)
# - Use absolute URLs for Sitemap directive
# - Test with Google Search Console
# - Block admin, API, and development paths
# - Don't use for sensitive data (use authentication instead)
# - Update when site structure changes
#
