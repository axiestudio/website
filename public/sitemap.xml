<!-- 
  SITEMAP FUNCTION & ELEMENT IMPORTANCE
  
  PRIMARY FUNCTION:
  A sitemap is an XML file that helps search engines discover, crawl, and index your website pages more efficiently.
  It serves as a roadmap of your site's content and provides metadata about each page.
  
  ELEMENT IMPORTANCE HIERARCHY:
  
  1. <loc> (CRITICAL - Required)
     - The actual URL of the page
     - Must be absolute and accessible
     - Most important for search engine discovery
  
  2. <lastmod> (HIGH IMPORTANCE)
     - Tells search engines when content was last updated
     - Helps prioritize crawling of fresh content
     - Critical for sites with frequently changing content
  
  3. <changefreq> (MEDIUM IMPORTANCE)
     - Provides hint about update frequency
     - Helps search engines optimize crawl scheduling
     - Not a guarantee, just guidance for crawlers
  
  4. <priority> (LOW-MEDIUM IMPORTANCE)
     - Relative importance compared to other pages on YOUR site
     - Does NOT affect ranking compared to other websites
     - Helps search engines understand your site's structure
  
  BEST PRACTICES:
  - Keep sitemaps under 50,000 URLs and 50MB
  - Use consistent URL formats (with/without trailing slashes)
  - Submit sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
  - Update automatically when content changes (like this file does!)
